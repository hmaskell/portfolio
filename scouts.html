                    <h3>I designed an interface for an achievenment tracker website for Girl Scouts.</h3>
                    <p>Girl Scouts from all over the world come to this site to see how many Brownie Points they have amassed, and are motivated to earn more when they see their ranking on the leaderboard. Scouts earn points by selling cookies, earning badges, and participating in Scouting activities. </p>

                    <p>Girl Scouts range from ages 5 - 17, but the majority are ages 8-12. The girls who visit the site are already registered. They visit to check how many points they’ve earned, what their ranking is among their troupe, their friends, and among all Scouts worldwide. They want to see what points their friends have earned, and what they did to earn them. This is designed to motivate young girls to compete lightly with one another, encouraging them to participate in the program further to earn additional points. </p>

                    <p>Designing for children presents a certain responsibility to consider the vulnerability of there users. As such, I have deliberately excluded a function to comment on posts as a preventative measure against bullying. Similarly, when users “heart” other users’ activity, they cannot see how many “hearts” that post has amassed, nor who “hearted” it. When others heart a user’s post, the poster alone can see how many “hearts” they received. Social media has proven itself an ego-driven beast, and children are as susceptible as any of us to insecurities resulting from not receiving as much digital love as others. This way, users can only feel the positivity of receiving hearts, rather than jealousy at others’, and can only benchmark against their own hearts on other posts.</p>

                </section>
                    <p>Furthermore, I have made it difficult to quickly count how many badges or friends any given user has. They can view thumbnails of a users’ badges, and friends, but they are set up so that when you reach the end, you are at the beginning. This helps avoid negative comparisons, and makes more room for celebrating others’ achievements.</p>
